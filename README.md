# StellarFramework
 About this framework:
   
   Important advice: I have to change the license of remove conditions in that, but I will not do at this moment. Anyway for sure I will not remove the License and copyright notice condition.
 
   - This is a framework and librery that I am doing for all the plugins I will do in the future, private and publics.
   - Include small plugins or more big like gamemodes.
   - This framework have parts that can be used as librery and it use Java 8 and gradle.
   - Right now the framework only support latest version 1.19.3 and will be updated when a new version come but maybe in the future I will add support to others olders versions.
 
 About me:
 
   - I am new developing and with Java and create minecraft plugins so dont expect so much from my but I will do my best ;)
   - I am from Spain so my natal language is Spanish.
   - I use chatgpt ai and github copilot for help me developing more fast and for learn better and faster how develope.
   - I love doing innovating things in minecraft as plugin, anyway of some ideas are not 100% original and maybe just are not as plugin but as minecraft map.
   - I don't like to redo things that are already well done by reinventing the wheel so I usually prefer to use libraries for certain things than to do them myself. 
     I don't always do it this way but many times and other times I just modify some libreries of others.
   - You can contact me in discord Elguerrero|MoonWalker#8804 but you have to send me friend request because I have my direct dm bloqued.

 Credits to others libreries and frameworks that I used as dependencies:

  - Boosted-yaml from dejvokep dev [https://github.com/dejvokep/boosted-yaml] | (Right now all the config.yml and messages.yml system are managed with this library.)
