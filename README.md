# StellarFramework

 ### Important advices:
 
   - I dont recommend right now use this framework for create a plugin as it is in a early development build and maybe contain errors and bad code, more it dont have so much features yet.
   So if you want to use it, I recommend you to wait some time when the framework be better.
   - I have to change the license of remove conditions in that, but I will not do at this moment. Anyway for sure I will not remove the License and copyright notice condition.

 ### About this framework:
 
   - This is a framework and librery that I am doing for all the plugins I will do in the future, private and publics.
   - I invite to anyone to collaborate with the framework doing suggestions or create pull request :)
   - Include small plugins or more big plugins like gamemodes.
   - This framework have parts that can be used as librery and it use Java 8 and gradle.
   - Right now the framework only support latest version 1.19.3 and will be updated when a new version come but maybe in the future I will add support to others olders versions.

 ### Permissions that the framework have for each plugin that use that:

  - pluginname.* (All permissions of the plugin)
  - pluginname.help (Permission to use help)
  - pluginname.debug (Permission to use debug command and for see debug messages)
  - pluginname.reload (Permission to use reload command)

 ### About me:
 
   - I am new developing and with Java and create minecraft plugins so dont expect so much from my but I will do my best ;)
   - I am from Spain so my natal language is Spanish.
   - I only know right Java language.
   - I use chatgpt ai and github copilot for help me developing more fast and for learn better and faster how develope.
   - I love doing innovating things in minecraft as plugin, anyway of some ideas are not 100% original and maybe just are not as plugin but as minecraft map.
   - I don't like to redo things that are already well done by reinventing the wheel so I usually prefer to use libraries for certain things than to do them myself. 
     I don't always do it this way but many times and other times I just modify some libreries of others.
   - You can contact me in discord Elguerrero|MoonWalker#8804 but you have to send me friend request because I have my direct dm bloqued.

 ### Credits to others libreries and frameworks that I used as dependencies:

  - Foundation from Kangarko dev [https://github.com/kangarko/Foundation] | (I use some parts of it on my framework, anyway of most time I modify it. I will specify what parts I use in the future.)
  - Boosted-yaml from dejvokep dev [https://github.com/dejvokep/boosted-yaml] | (Right now all the config.yml and messages.yml system are managed with this library.)
  - Commandapi from JorelAli dev [https://github.com/JorelAli/CommandAPI] | (Right now all the command parts of the code are made with this library.)
  - I will use more libreries that are planned in the future.
